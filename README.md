# Kitchen Classics
**Description** 
- Kitchen Classics is an app that allows users to store their recipes into one organized list (with the most recent recipe entry being entered at the top). The user would have the ability to see their recipes on the main page and if they choose to see a more detailed version of their recipe, they can do this by clicking on the title of the recipe which gives them access to such content. To create a new recipe, users would have click on the new link, which would lead them to a page that asks for the recipes title, ingredients, instructions, cook time, and an image if the user chooses to add one. The app also contains an edit link which gives the user the ability to edit their recipes and see a new, updated version of their recipe on the main page. Furthermore, the user also has the capability of deleting their recipe, meaning that once its been deleted, the recipe would be removed from the database and would not be visible to the user. Finally, the app also contains a recommendation page with a few pre-recorded recipes. The user has the ability to take these pre-recorded recipes and add it to their main recipes list.
